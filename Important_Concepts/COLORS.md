# Colors

By colors, we mean those that you have selected for your set and much match to from the options available to you. Unfortunately, it isnâ€™t as simple as digitally choosing a color (either by RGB, CMYK, HSL, Hex, etc) and going straight to production.

Each keycap manufacturing has their own set of standard colours that they work with, (for example: Signature Plastic ABS and GMK standard colours) and so, dependent on your manufacturer of choice, you can be limited in the range of colours available to you. Custom colors are available using colour matching systems (Pantone & RAL) but it is best to ask the manufacturer regarding color, their color matching process, and the limitations involved.


With all the above said it would be best to start by learning about color matching (ADD LINK) and colour theory (ADD LINK). In order to ensure that you are getting the correct colors, it will be likely that you will need to invest in a physical Pantone or RAL reference/color collection. (Colloquially, a "Pantone Book.")  There is no shortcut to this process; it is important you take the time and money needed to do things right. If you do not have enough money, consider asking around for people who can send you pictures of the samples, or even better, lend you the book. Make sure you consider that pictures sent through the web will not be perfect.
