## Color Matching and its Importance
Quite simply, color matching is the process of ensuring that the colors of your end product match the colors you are representing in your renders or other promotional materials.

Without color matching throughout the design and manufacturing process, your customers might end up with a product that does not match what they believed they were purchasing, or it might not match your creative vision.

While it is natural to believe at first that you can make use of how colors appear on your monitor to make color matching decisions, this is not recommended - monitors, color profiles, and many other things can mean that two people looking at the same digital color can, and usually will, end up seeing the color differently. To resolve this, we perform color matching utilizing a standardized physical reference.

> This portion of the guide is written assuming you are working backwards from a digital reference rather than the other.

## Performing Color Matching
The first step is to get a physical reference. In most cases, this is a color book from RAL or Pantone. It can, however, be most anything. People have gone as far as sending a Gameboy to GMK to match against.

### The first stage of color matching
The first and arguably most important stage of color matching is the one you perform yourself. While it is perfectly acceptable to mock up your set in digital format, you will need to find the physical references you want to base your set upon.

#### Picking your physical reference
The manufacturer you are running your set with will make a major difference on what the most convenient physical reference book is. Most manufacturers have their preference prefer to work with Pantone. For specifics, please see [Vendors](./Important Concepts/vendors.md). Manufacturers such as GMK and Signature Plastics also have stock colors that you can purchase physical samples of. Working from these or a book that your manufacturer supports will mean that you both have common ground to match against, and that you do not need to ship some other physical sample around the globe.

If you are working with RAL, the RAL K7 is an excellent starting book. It provides 213 colors that GMK and many other manufacturers can color match against. It is relatively inexpensive compared to the other two primary offerings, but has a limited color palette.

The RAL D2 is the step up within the RAL ecosystem, bringing you to roughly 2000 colors. Not all manufacturers support matching to RAL D2.

The Pantone Formula Guide is your pick for manufacturers that do not work with RAL. It is generally sold as a bundle with both the coated and uncoated versions. Manufacturers may have preferences on which of the guides they prefer to work with.

Pantone also offers plastic chips that can be purchased individually for most colors in their primary color system. RAL offers a subset of colors.

You do not need the Pantone Bridge guide.

#### Performing the matching
This is the important part, but if you take your time and pay attention, it is not difficult. Once you have your physical references in hand, it is time to start performing the matching. In its simplest form, this largely means holding up pages from the color books you purchased up against your monitor until you find the closest match to it and confirm
that you like the color. Remember, you can represent many times more colors digitally than will be available in your RAL or Pantone book. That's OK! You just have to find a color in the books you like, and then begin tweaking your digital output, be they renders, KLE output, etc, to more closely match the color as it appears in real life.

Lighting is an important thing to take note of. The colors you see on a monitor are being emitted by said monitor, and the colors on your physical sample are being reflected by other light off of the sample. This means that you will never be able to truly get a perfect match. It also means that lighting differences between where you do your color matching and where people view the completed set will have an impact on the reflected color seen.

In most cases, you want to perform your color matching in lighting that has a temperature of 5000K to 6500K - the Pantone book provides a calibration swatch at the back tuned for 5000K, and the range between the two is a common range for office lighting. Bulbs will frequently have their color temperature marked on them or their box. You also are ideally working with lighting that has a high CRI - Color Rendering Index - because this will also impact the way colors are viewed. You want to shoot for a 90+ CRI bulb.

If you are unable to verify your lighting temperature, or it's CRI, natural sunlight, particularly during the afternoon hours of the day will get you in the 5500K to 6000K range, with an overcast day being roughly 6500K. As CRI is measured against natural sunlight, the sun would be the equivalent of a 100 CRI bulb.

You are "done" with this stage once you have found the physical representation that most closely matches your vision for the set. This is likely not going to be a perfect match for any of your digital representations.

#### You've got your Pantone or RAL or stock color picked out. What now?
As briefly mentioned before, it is now time to make your digital representation match the physical one as closely as you can. Begin tweaking the color in your KLE or renders until it gets as close to your physical sample as you can get it.

This is important to help the people buying your set get as good of an idea of what it will look like as possible. While it is impossible to get them a perfect representation for all the reasons we previously outlined, we want to get as close as we can.

## After the initial color match
Awesome! You've made it through one of the most important portions of the keyset design process, but it is not the last time color matching will be performed when working on this set. The next person doing color matching will be an employee at your manufacturer - they will begin to tweak their manufacturing process and ink combination to make their plastic or print match the physical reference you provided. For some manufacturers, this will begin after your group buy. Others, you can request samples prior to an IC.

Once they believe they have matched the colors, they will send you the samples to evaluate. From here, you need to perform color matching once more and make sure that the samples match the reference you chose. If they do, manufacturing can be greenlit for when there is room in the production queue. If not, they will need to continue tweaking their color formula, and the process will repeat.

(You will also want to place a disclaimer in your Interest Check that renders and similar are a best effort representation, but cannot be perfect matches for what they will see in real life.)

## TL;DR
* Hex values are not accurate between the real world and screens, as they will vary based on a variety of factors. Yes, even if they are provided by Pantone themselves. A physical reference, such as a RAL or Pantone book, is strictly necessary to perform color matching.
* You are unlikely to ever get a perfect match, so once you find a physical reference for a color that matches your vision for the set, begin tweaking your digital representations to closer match it.
* Lighting is important. 5000k to 6500k, high CRI, or natural daylight.
* Not matching colors to physical references is largely unacceptable and has a very high chance of resulting in angry customers.
* Make sure to disclaim in your IC that the set was physically color matches so renders are just a best effort representation.
* Don't forget or lose your physical references - you will need them to match against manufacturing samples.
* Pantone / RAL books and similar fade with exposure to sunlight, color shift from oxidation, etc. Be aware that after a few years they may shift from the original color in a significant way.
