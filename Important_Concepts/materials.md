# Important Concepts: Materials

There are two prominent types of plastic in the keycap industry. These are ABS and PBT.  Both of these plastics offer a good level of mechanical strength and resistance to heat, electricity, acids, and solvents which makes them highly suitable for use as keycaps. Note: There are other types, such as POM, however these are not widely manufactured and will not be covered in this document.

No doubt at some point in your lifetime you will have unknowingly come into contact with both of these thermoplastic polymers. For example, Lego bricks are made from ABS and PBT will likely be the material your showerhead and soldering iron are made from. Each manufacturer has manufacturing capabilities and is usually limited to a single type of plastic. However, recently, manufacturers have started expanding infrastructure to be able to produce both ABS and PBT. (see: ePBT)
In terms of keycap manufacturing, and when comparing one against the other, both have their pros and cons:

| | Pros | Cons |
| --- | ----------- | ----- |
| ABS | - Easily molded through injection molding <br> - Vibrant Colours <br> - High degree of surface quality <br> - Legends are much sharper than PBT alternatives due to the manufacturing process | - Shines over time with use <br> - Will discolour from UV radiation <br> - Scratches easily <br> - Poor solvent resistance, particularly aromatic, ketones and esters <br> - Can suffer from stress cracking in the presence of some greases |
| PBT | - Resistant to solvents <br> - High level of heat resistance <br> - Highly resistant to wear and discoloration from UV radiation <br> - Excellent stain resistant and machining characteristics <br> - Enables efficient use of material to reduce weight and cost (Cheaper) | - Harder to injection mould due to high level of heat resistance <br> - Does not lend itself well to vibrant colours <br> - High mold shrinkage <br> - Unreinforced PBT is notch sensitive <br> - Sensitive to hot water (60°C/140°F) and therefore more likely to warp slightly during manufacturing, most noticeably on spacebars. |

> **NOTE:** Before you design something you should always try different plastics to make a decision for yourself. At the end of the day both these plastics have uses outside of keycaps and are designed for those purposes.
