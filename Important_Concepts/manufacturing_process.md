# Important Concepts: Manufacturing Process

| | Pros | Cons |
| --- | ----------- | ----- |
| Dye Sublimation | - Fewer limitations <br> - Use of the entire keycap surface area <br> - (Cheaper) Custom Legends <br> - Multi-colour legends <br> - Thinner line width needed for novelties | - Warpage is more common <br> - Not as vibrant colours <br> - Blurrier Legends |
| Doubleshot (Injection Molding) | - Vibrant Colours <br> - Crisp and clean legends | - Limiting line width (Novelties/Legends) <br> - Custom legends can be expensive to produce <br> - Generally limited to what molds the manufacturer already has <br> - Limited to two colours per key (unless doing Tripleshot, but JTK is the only manufacturer to offer tripleshot at this time.) |
