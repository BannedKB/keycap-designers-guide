# Getting ready to post an IC
Before you post your IC, there are a few requirements for a good IC that must be met.
- A set profile and material, if not manufacturer. Information on manufacturers, materials, and profiles are in the [important concepts section.](Important_Concepts)
- You should have physical colors chosen, whether it be from a Pantone, RAL, or other form of color matching, as mentioned in the [color matching section.](Important_Concepts/color_matching.md)
- Renders of boards and kits, color matched as closely as possible, to give people an idea of how your set will look in real life. 
- Kitting that has been thought out. It doesn't have to be final, but it should be close to it. Information on kitting is in the [kitting section.](Comprehensive_Kitting)

Once these requirements are met, you can start writing your IC. Typically, you want to have your IC laid out in a simple, easy to follow layout, that provides as much information as possible. You want to make your set appealing to buyers and vendors/collaborators.
