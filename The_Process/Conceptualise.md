# Conceptualise/Design

It is at this stage that you should consider a number of aspects of your design. This includes; Your colour palette, kitting, profile and material. The recommended starting point is [Keyboard-Layout-Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/), this is a tool that already has a lot of built in options and should be thoroughly explored. 

When starting a design there are a lot of things to take into consideration right from the start. We have already covered some of these aspects above in the marketing section. Keep in mind each decision you set in stone will have an affect on all of the other options that you have available. For example, if you are set on SA profile keycaps, either Maxkey or Signature Plastics/ABS/Double Shot (Manu/Material/Process) are the only other options you have. If you are set on PBT, GMK is out of the question but Signature Plastics DSA and DCS profiles can be used. (See the Manufacturing Shopping List for more information). Once you’ve mocked up your idea you can move onto looking for feedback.

**PLEASE NOTE:** When designing a keyset, you can’t use generic hex colors such as #FFFFFF or #020202. Manufacturers are unable to produce these colours because they are not industry standard. Whilst it is fine to use Hexes as a starting point for the concept of your design **do not become attached to them** as you will need to replace these with either Pantone, RAL or a physical reference through a process of colour matching.
